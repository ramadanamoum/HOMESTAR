                            There are three basic variations on the roulette theme in casinos around the world, Roulette Wheel and Chips although the differences are very small. They are British, American and French. In France the American roulette game is called English Roulette, which is more accurate.

                            The game is all about predicting where a little white ball will come to rest after spinning around the rim of a roulette wheel. The ball circles for as many as 40 revolutions and as few as 4, the carousel (middle bit with the slots in, or hub) spins continuously in the opposite direction. When the ball and carousel collide, the ball bounces randomly and eventually runs out of steam to rest in a slot with a number attached to it. That number is the winning one.

                            Its a fast action game that brings out the best and the worst of tempers.

                            TAmerican like to play roulette with a "00" and a hefty edge against them. The wheel has the normal numbers from 1 to 36 in alternate red and black colours with a green zero and also their 'double zero', also green. 
                            </p>

                            Therefore the game has a total of 38 numbers to bet on. The edge against the player is large and consequently the game is not nearly so popular there.

                            British have the numbers in a different order to an American wheel. Both alternate red and black but the European wheel also alternates high and low where as the U.S wheel alternates two low, two high. British wheels only have zero, no double zero!! 37 numbers on the table.

                                This game can actually be interesting to play and if you do your homework (read some books) then you can cut the house edge down to nothing (Warning: this is tough!).

                                To play you must first place a bet (say £10). Two cards are dealt face up to you and one to the dealer. Your aim is to make your cards total more than the dealers but not go over 21 (bust) which forfeits your bet.. You may ask for additional cards and once you've decided to stop taking them the dealer begins adding cards to their hand. They must draw a card if their total is less than 17 and stop once they reach 17 or more. 
                                </p>

                                Over 21 (bust or 'too many') and the players hand wins if it is still live.

                                If your total is higher than the dealer's or the dealer has bust, then your bet is paid at even odds, that means you win an amount equal to your bet. A Blackjack is a two card hand consisting of a picture card (that includes 10s) and an Ace. That pays 3/2 (£15 for £10 bet), for the player. 
                                </p>

                                If your total is lower then you lose your bet and if equal then you get your money back (a stand-off, a push).

                            This is a casino-dealer dealt table game. Its you against the house with real poker hands. Each player gets dealt five cards face down along with the dealer who gets four down cards and one up card. There is an ante bet before the player gets his cards and if they wish to continue and play against Four Aces Poker Hand the dealers hand then they must make another bet (or raise) of exactly twice the ante. If they don't then they forfeit their ante. (See How To Play Casino Stud Poker)

                            For the dealer to play against the player, they must have a qualifying hand of Ace,King,x,x,x (x is any card) or better (this happens 56% of the time). If the player has decided on playing and making the necessary raise and the dealer qualifies, then its a straight show-down of who has got the best poker hand. If the dealer wins they take all three units bet. If the player wins he will win either 3 units or a bonus payout if he has a strong hand (better than one pair).
